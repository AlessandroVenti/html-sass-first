               <h1>Judy Alvarez</h1>
               <p>  
                    Judy was born in Laguna Bend, a small town in the rural outskirts of Night City. 
                    Her father was never around, and her mother died when she was just a child. 
                    She still has a photo of her, but can barely remember her mother anymore. 
                    Judy was raised instead by her grandparents. 
                    Her grandfather was a techie and taught her all that she knows. 
                    She also loved to hear the stories he told. 
                    Her grandmother was temperamental, something Judy herself seemingly inherited.
